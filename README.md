# Music Study Session Automation

This program simplifies your music practice routine by automating the selection of music sheets for each study session. It helps you efficiently manage your music sheets based on key factors like total practice time, last practice date, and proficiency.

## How It Works

1. **Input Your Music Sheets:** Start by inputting your music sheets into the program.

2. **Set Your Preferences:** Define your desired study session time and the number of pieces you want to study during each session.

3. **Automated Selection:** The program selects music pieces for your study session based on:
   - Total practice time
   - Last practice date
   - Proficiency (lower proficiency gets priority)

4. **Optimize Your Practice:** Enjoy an organized and optimized practice routine tailored to your goals and preferences.
